(* Scheduler description:

   The Javascript, browser scheduler relies on yielding to the Javascript engine
   to allow IO tasks to complete. There are a few different corner cases to be aware
   of:

    - The [IO] job is used to fix the "busy yielding" problem.
    - Calls to [scheduled_wakeup] are coalesced by checking if the timer has already
      been set or not. If the timer callback is fired, the timer id is removed.

   When do we need to "schedule a wakeup"? From the code this happens in two places,
   whenever we hit the [IO] job or whenever we run one of the [enqueue_] functions
   which are called in callbacks that are trying to enqueue a continuation to resume.

   [IO] case: this is necessary in the "busy yielding" example.

   [enqueue_] case: this is necessary for IO. Consider calling [Eio_browser.Timeout.sleep ~ms:200].
   This wants to register the continuation to be run whenever the callback passed to [set_timeout]
   is run. The path through our scheduler would be:

     - The initial IO job is put in the run queue.
     - The timeout function is called.
     - We are then idle allowing the IO job's wakeup to run, calling the scheduler.
     - The run queue is empty so we hit [None] and are idle again.
     - The timeout callback function is called enqueuing the continuation but no wakeup
       is currently set to actually run the scheduler, so we call wakeup.
