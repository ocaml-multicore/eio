(* This example shows how to trace an Eio program.

   The [main] function creates a listening socket and has a client connect and send a message,
   which is handled by a server fiber.

   At the same time, another fiber is displaying trace events.
   For simplicity, this example runs the tracer in the same process as the program being traced,
   but typically they would be separate processes. *)
