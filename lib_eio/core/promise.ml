(* Note on thread-safety

   Promises can be shared between domains, so everything here must be thread-safe.

   Wrapping everything in a mutex would be one way to do that, but that makes reads
   slow, and only one domain would be able to read at a time.

   Instead, we use an Atomic to hold the state, plus an additional mutex for the waiters
   while in the Unresolved state. This makes resolved promises faster (at the cost of
   making operations on unresolved promises a bit slower). It also makes reasoning about
   the code more fun.

   We can think of atomics and mutexes as "boxes", containing values and
   invariants. To use them, you open the box to get access to the contents,
   then close the box afterwards, restoring the invariant. For mutexes,
   open/close is lock/unlock. For atomics, every operation implicitly opens and
   closes the box. Any number of callers can share a reference to the box
   itself; the runtime ensures a box can only be opened by one user at a time.

   We can hold a full reference to something (meaning no-one else has access to it
   and we can mutate it), or a fraction (giving us read-only access but also
   ensuring that no-one else can mutate it either). *)

type 'a state =

  (* The Unresolved state's mutex box contains:
     - Full access to the Waiters.

     - The invariant that if the promise is resolved then the waiters list is empty. *)

type !'a t = {
  id : Ctf.id;

     - A non-zero share of the reference to the Resolved state.
