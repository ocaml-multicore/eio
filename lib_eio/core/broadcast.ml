(* See the Cells module for an overview of this system.

   Each new waiter atomically increments the "suspend" pointer and writes
   a callback there. The waking fiber removes all the callbacks and calls them.
   In this version, "resume" never gets ahead of "suspend" (broadcasting just
   brings it up-to-date with the "suspend" pointer).

   When the resume fiber runs, some of the cells reserved for callbacks might
   not yet have been filled. In this case, the resuming fiber just marks them
   as needing to be resumed. When the suspending fiber continues, it will
   notice this and continue immediately. *)

module Cell = struct
  (* For any given cell, there are two actors running in parallel: the
     suspender and the resumer.

     The resumer only performs a single operation (resume).

     The consumer waits to be resumed and then, optionally, cancels.

     This means we only have three cases to think about:

     1. Consumer adds request (Empty -> Request).
        1a. Provider fulfills it (Request -> Resumed).
        1b. Consumer cancels it (Request -> Cancelled).
     2. Provider gets to cell first (Empty -> Resumed).
        When the consumer tries to wait, it resumes immediately.

     The Resumed state should never been seen. It exists only to allow the
     request to be GC'd promptly. We could replace it with Empty, but having
     separate states is clearer for debugging. *)
