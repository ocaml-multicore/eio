(* There is a tree of cancellation contexts for each domain.
   A fiber is always in exactly one context, but can move to a new child and back (see [sub]).
   While a fiber is performing a cancellable operation, it sets a cancel function.
   When a context is cancelled, we call each fiber's cancellation function (first replacing it with [ignore]).
   Cancelling always happens from the fiber's own domain.
   An operation may either finish normally or be cancelled (not both).
   If a function can succeed in a separate domain,
   the user's cancel function is responsible for ensuring that this is done atomically. *)
