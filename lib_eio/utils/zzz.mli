    Your cancel function should call {!remove} (in addition to resuming it). *)

val pop : t -> now:Mtime.t -> [`Due of item | `Wait_until of Mtime.t | `Nothing]
(** [pop ~now t] removes and returns the earliest item due by [now].
    For fibers, it also clears the thread's cancel function.
    If no item is due yet, it returns the time the earliest item becomes due. *)
