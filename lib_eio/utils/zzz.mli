(** [add t time thread] adds a new event, due at [time], and returns its ID. You
    must use {!Eio.Private.Fiber_context.set_cancel_fn} on [thread] before
    calling {!pop}. Your cancel function should call {!remove} (in addition to
    resuming [thread]). *)

val remove : t -> Key.t -> unit
(** [remove t key] removes an event previously added with [add]. *)

val pop :

  now:float ->
  [ `Due of unit Suspended.t | `Wait_until of float | `Nothing ]
(** [pop ~now t] removes and returns the earliest thread due by [now]. It also
    clears the thread's cancel function. If no thread is due yet, it returns the
    time the earliest thread becomes due. *)
