(** Flows are used to represent byte streams, such as open files and network sockets.
    A {!source} provides a stream of bytes. A {!sink} consumes a stream.
    A {!two_way} can do both.

    To read structured data (e.g. a line at a time), wrap a source using {!Buf_read}. *)

(** {2 Reading} *)

val single_read : _ source -> Cstruct.t -> int
(** [single_read src buf] reads one or more bytes into [buf].

    It returns the number of bytes read (which may be less than the
    buffer size even if there is more data to be read).

    - Use {!read_exact} instead if you want to fill [buf] completely.
    - Use {!Buf_read.line} to read complete lines.
    - Use {!copy} to stream data directly from a source to a sink.

    [buf] must not be zero-length.

    @raise End_of_file if there is no more data to read *)

val read_exact : _ source -> Cstruct.t -> unit
(** [read_exact src dst] keeps reading into [dst] until it is full.
    @raise End_of_file if the buffer could not be filled. *)

val string_source : string -> source_ty r
(** [string_source s] is a source that gives the bytes of [s]. *)

val cstruct_source : Cstruct.t list -> source_ty r
(** [cstruct_source cs] is a source that gives the bytes of [cs]. *)

type 't read_method += Read_source_buffer of ('t -> (Cstruct.t list -> int) -> unit)
(** If a source offers [Read_source_buffer rsb] then the user can call [rsb t fn]
    to borrow a view of the source's buffers. [fn] returns the number of bytes it consumed.

    [rsb] will raise [End_of_file] if no more data will be produced.
    If no data is currently available, [rsb] will wait for some to become available before calling [fn].

    [fn] must not continue to use the buffers after it returns. *)

(** {2 Writing} *)

val write : _ sink -> Cstruct.t list -> unit
(** [write dst bufs] writes all bytes from [bufs].

    You should not perform multiple concurrent writes on the same flow
    (the output may get interleaved).

    This is a low level API. Consider using:

    - {!Buf_write} to combine multiple small writes.
    - {!copy} for bulk transfers, as it allows some extra optimizations. *)

val single_write : _ sink -> Cstruct.t list -> int
(** [single_write dst bufs] writes at least one byte from [bufs] and returns the number of bytes written. *)

val copy : _ source -> _ sink -> unit
(** [copy src dst] copies data from [src] to [dst] until end-of-file. *)

val copy_string : string -> _ sink -> unit
(** [copy_string s = copy (string_source s)] *)

val buffer_sink : Buffer.t -> sink_ty r
(** [buffer_sink b] is a sink that adds anything sent to it to [b].

    To collect data as a cstruct, use {!Buf_read} instead. *)

(** {2 Bidirectional streams} *)

type two_way_ty = [source_ty | sink_ty | shutdown_ty]
type 'a two_way = ([> two_way_ty] as 'a) r

val shutdown : _ two_way -> shutdown_command -> unit
(** [shutdown t cmd] indicates that the caller has finished reading or writing [t]
    (depending on [cmd]).

    This is useful in some protocols to indicate that you have finished sending the request,
    and that the remote peer should now send the response. *)

(** {2 Closing}

    Flows are usually attached to switches and closed automatically when the switch
    finishes. However, it can be useful to close them sooner manually in some cases. *)

val close : [> `Close] r -> unit
(** Alias of {!Resource.close}. *)
