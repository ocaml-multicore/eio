(** Flows are used to represent byte streams, such as open files and network sockets.
    A {!source} provides a stream of bytes. A {!sink} consumes a stream.

(** [read src buf] reads one or more bytes into [buf].

    It returns the number of bytes read (which may be less than the
    buffer size even if there is more data to be read).
    [read src] just makes a single call to [src#read_into]
    (and asserts that the result is in range).

    - Use {!read_exact} instead if you want to fill [buf] completely.
    - Use {!Buf_read.line} to read complete lines.
    - Use {!copy} to stream data directly from a source to a sink.

    [buf] must not be zero-length.

val read_methods : #source -> read_method list
(** [read_methods flow] is a list of extra ways of reading from [flow],
    with the preferred (most efficient) methods first.

    If no method is suitable, {!read} should be used as the fallback. *)

(** If a source offers [Read_source_buffer rsb] then the user can call [rsb fn]
    to borrow a view of the source's buffers. [fn] returns the number of bytes it consumed.

    [rsb] will raise [End_of_file] if no more data will be produced.
    If no data is currently available, [rsb] will wait for some to become available before calling [fn].

    [fn] must not continue to use the buffers after it returns. *)

    and that the remote peer should now send the response. *)

(** {2 Closing}

    finished. However, it can be useful to close them sooner manually in some cases. *)
