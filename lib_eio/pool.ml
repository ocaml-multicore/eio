(* A pool is a sequence of cells containing either available slots or consumers waiting for them.
   A slot may or may not contain an actual resource.

   To use a resource:

   1. Get the next "suspend" cell. If it contains a resource slot, use it.
   2. If no slot is ready and we're below capacity, create a new slot and add it (to the next resume cell).
   3. Either way, wait for the cell to be resumed with a slot.
   4. Once you have a slot, ensure it contains a resource, creating one if not.
   5. When done, add the slot back (in the next resume cell).
