(** Waiters call {!await} in a loop as long as some condition is false. Fibers
    that modify inputs to the condition must call [broadcast] soon afterwards so
    that waiters can re-check the condition.

    Example:

    {[
      let x = ref 0
      let cond = Eio.Condition.create ()
      let mutex = Eio.Mutex.create ()

      let set_x value =
        Eio.Mutex.use_rw ~protect:false mutex (fun () -> x := value);
        Eio.Condition.broadcast cond

      let await_x p =
        Eio.Mutex.use_ro mutex (fun () ->
            while not (p !x) do
              (* [x] cannot change, as mutex is locked. *)
              Eio.Condition.await ~mutex
                cond (* Mutex is unlocked while suspended. *)
            done)
    ]}

    It is used like this:

    {[
      Fiber.both
        (fun () ->
          traceln "x = %d" !x;
          await_x (( = ) 42);
          traceln "x = %d" !x)
        (fun () ->
          set_x 5;
          Fiber.yield ();
          set_x 7;
          set_x 42)
    ]} *)

type t

val create : unit -> t
(** [create ()] creates a new condition variable. *)

val await : t -> Eio_mutex.t -> unit
(** [await t mutex] suspends the current fiber until it is notified by [t].

    You should lock [mutex] before testing whether the condition is true, and
    leave it locked while calling this function. It will be unlocked while the
    fiber is waiting and locked again before returning (it is also locked again
    if the wait is cancelled). *)

val await_no_mutex : t -> unit
(** [await_no_mutex t] suspends the current fiber until it is notified by [t].

    This is only safe to use in the case where [t] is only used within a single
    domain, and the test for the condition was done without switching fibers.
    i.e. you know the condition is still false, and no notification of a change
    can be sent until [await_no_mutex] has finished suspending the fiber. *)

val broadcast : t -> unit
(** [broadcast t] wakes up any waiting fibers (by appending them to the
    run-queue to resume later).

    If no fibers are waiting, nothing happens. *)
