(** Extension of {!Eio} for integration with OCaml's [Unix] module.

    Note that OCaml's [Unix] module is not safe, and therefore care must be taken when using these functions.
    For example, it is possible to leak file descriptors this way, or to use them after they've been closed,
    allowing one module to corrupt a file belonging to an unrelated module. *)

      @param close_unix If [true], closing the object will also close the underlying FD.

    It can also be used in programs that don't care about tracking determinism. *)
