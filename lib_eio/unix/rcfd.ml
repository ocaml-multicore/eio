(* To prevent races closing FDs, we do some ref-counting.

   Logically, the states of the wrapper for an FD [x] are:

   - open : the FD is available for use.
   - closing/users : no further operations can start, but some are still in progress.
   - closing/no-users : all operations have finished.
   - closing/closed : we no longer own the FD.

   We start by dividing ownership of [x] into [max_int] shares
   (enough shares for every sys-thread to take one).
   Having a fractional share (not 0 or 1) means you can use [x] but not close it.

   In the [open] and [closing/users] states, [t] owns the fraction
   [(max_int - ops) / max_int] of [x].

   In [closing/no-users], [t] owns all of [x].

   Initially, [t] is in the [open] state and [ops = 0].

   If you increment [ops] in [open] or [closing/users], you get one share and can use the FD
   (though in [closing/users] you should immediately return it).
   When you decrement [ops] in these cases, you give back your share and must not use the FD further.

   If you increment/decrement when in the state [closing/no-users] or [closing/closed],
   you do not get/return a share.

   A fiber can call {!close} to move from [open] at any time.
   If there are operations in progress when it does this, it transitions to [closing/users].
   Otherwise, it goes directly to [closing/no-users].
   The fiber that does this is known as the "closing fiber"
   and is responsible for finishing the close.

   We move from [closing/users] to [closing/no-users] when [ops] becomes 0
   (and [t] therefore owns all shares of [x]).
   [ops] may continue to change after this, but we never return to [closing/users]
   or give any user a share of [x] after this.

   From [closing/no-users], we transition to [closing/closed],
   transferring the now-full ownership of [x] to the closing fiber.

   In reality, the three [closing/*] states are represented by the single constructor [Closing],
   and the code must work whatever the true state might be. *)
