(** Cancelling other fibres when an exception occurs. *)
module Cancel : sig
  (** This is the low-level interface to cancellation.
      Every {!Switch} includes a cancellation context and most users will just use that API instead.

      Each domain has a tree of cancellation contexts, and every fibre is registered with one context.
      A fibre can switch to a different context (e.g. by calling {!sub}).
      When a context is cancelled, all registered fibres have their current cancellation function (if any)
      called and removed. Child contexts are cancelled too, recursively, unless marked as protected.

      Many operations also check that the current context hasn't been cancelled,
      so if a fibre is performing a non-cancellable operation it will still get cancelled soon afterwards.
      This check is typically done when starting an operation, not at the end.
      If an operation is cancelled after succeeding, but while still waiting on the run queue,
      it will still return the operation's result.
      A notable exception is {!Fibre.yield}, which checks at the end.
      You can also use {!Fibre.check} to check manually.

      Whether a fibre is cancelled through a cancellation function or by checking its context,
      it will receive a {!Cancelled} exception.
      It is possible the exception will get lost (if something catches it and forgets to re-raise).
      It is also possible to get this exception even when not cancelled, for example by awaiting
      a promise which another fibre has resolved to a cancelled exception.
      When in doubt, call {!Fibre.check ()} to find out if your fibre is really cancelled.
      Ideally this should be done any time you have caught an exception and are planning to ignore it,
      although if you forget then the next IO operation will typically abort anyway.

      Quick clean-up actions (such as releasing a mutex or deleting a temporary file) are OK,
      but operations that may block should be avoided.
      For example, a network connection should simply be closed,
      without attempting to send a goodbye message.

      The purpose of the cancellation system is to stop fibres quickly, not to report errors.
      Use {!Switch.fail} instead to record an error. *)
