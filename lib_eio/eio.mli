(** Effects based parallel IO for OCaml.

    Eio provides support for concurrency (juggling many tasks) and
    parallelism (using multiple CPU cores for performance).

    It provides facilities for creating and coordinating fibers (light-weight
    threads) and domains (for parallel processing), as well as interfaces for
    interacting with resources provided by the operating system.

    These features must be used within an {e event loop},
    provided by an Eio {e backend}.
    Applications can use {!Eio_main.run} to run a suitable loop.

    See {{:https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio}} for a tutorial. *)

    The general pattern here is that each type of resource has a set of functions for using it,
    plus an object type to allow defining your own implementations.
    To use the resources, it is recommended that you use the functions rather than calling
    methods directly. Using the functions results in better error messages from the compiler,
    and may provide extra features or sanity checks.

    The system resources are available from the {!Stdenv.t} provided by your event loop
    (e.g. {!Eio_main.run}). *)

val traceln :

(** [traceln fmt] outputs a debug message (typically to stderr).

    Trace messages are printed by default and do not require logging to be configured first.
    The message is printed with a newline, and is flushed automatically.
    [traceln] is intended for quick debugging rather than for production code.

    Unlike most Eio operations, [traceln] will never switch to another fiber;
    if the OS is not ready to accept the message then the whole domain waits.

    It is safe to call [traceln] from multiple domains at the same time.
    Each line will be written atomically.

    Examples:
    {[
      traceln "x = %d" x;
      traceln "x = %d" x ~__POS__;   (* With location information *)
