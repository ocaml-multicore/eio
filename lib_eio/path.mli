(** A [_ Path.t] represents a particular location in some filesystem. It is a
    pair of a base directory and a relative path from there.

    {!Eio.Stdenv.cwd} provides access to the current working directory. For
    example:

    {[
      let ( / ) = Eio.Path.( / )

      let run dir =
        Eio.Path.save ~create:(`Exclusive 0o600) (dir / "output.txt") "the data"

      let () = Eio_main.run @@ fun env -> run (Eio.Stdenv.cwd env)
    ]}

    It is normally not permitted to access anything above the base directory,
    even by following a symlink. The exception is {!Stdenv.fs}, which provides
    access to the whole file-system:

    {[
      Eio.Path.load (fs / "/etc/passwd")
    ]} *)

open Fs

type 'a t = (#Fs.dir as 'a) * path
(** An OS directory FD and a path relative to it, for use with e.g. [openat(2)]. *)

val ( / ) : 'a t -> string -> 'a t
(** [t / step] is [t] with [step] appended to [t]'s path, or replacing [t]'s
    path if [step] is absolute:

    - [(fd, "foo") / "bar" = (fd, "foo/bar")]
    - [(fd, "foo") / "/bar" = (fd, "/bar")] *)

val pp : _ t Fmt.t
(** [pp] formats a [_ t] as "<label:path>", suitable for logging. *)

(** {1 Reading files} *)

val load : _ t -> string
(** [load t] returns the contents of the given file.

    This is a convenience wrapper around {!with_open_in}. *)

val open_in : sw:Switch.t -> _ t -> < Flow.source ; Flow.close >
(** [open_in ~sw t] opens [t] for reading.

    Note: files are always opened in binary mode. *)

val with_open_in : _ t -> (< Flow.source ; Flow.close > -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_open_in] is like [open_in], but calls [fn flow] with the new flow and
    closes it automatically when [fn] returns (if it hasn't already been closed
    by then). *)

val with_lines : _ t -> (string Seq.t -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_lines t fn] is a convenience function for streaming the lines of the
    file.

    It uses {!Buf_read.lines}. *)

(** {1 Writing files} *)

val save : ?append:bool -> create:create -> _ t -> string -> unit
(** [save t data ~create] writes [data] to [t].

    This is a convenience wrapper around {!with_open_out}. *)

val open_out :
  sw:Switch.t -> ?append:bool -> create:create -> _ t -> < rw ; Flow.close >
(** [open_out ~sw t] opens [t] for reading and writing.

    Note: files are always opened in binary mode.

    @param append Open for appending: always write at end of file.
    @param create
      Controls whether to create the file, and what permissions to give it if
      so. *)

val with_open_out :
  ?append:bool -> create:create -> _ t -> (< rw ; Flow.close > -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_open_out] is like [open_out], but calls [fn flow] with the new flow
    and closes it automatically when [fn] returns (if it hasn't already been
    closed by then). *)

(** {1 Directories} *)

val mkdir : perm:Unix_perm.t -> _ t -> unit
(** [mkdir ~perm t] creates a new directory [t] with permissions [perm]. *)

val open_dir : sw:Switch.t -> _ t -> < dir ; Flow.close > t
(** [open_dir ~sw t] opens [t].

    This can be passed to functions to grant access only to the subtree [t]. *)

val with_open_dir : _ t -> (< dir ; Flow.close > t -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_open_dir] is like [open_dir], but calls [fn dir] with the new
    directory and closes it automatically when [fn] returns (if it hasn't
    already been closed by then). *)

val read_dir : _ t -> string list
(** [read_dir t] reads directory entries for [t]. The entries are sorted using
    {!String.compare}.*)

(** {1 Other} *)

val unlink : _ t -> unit
(** [unlink t] removes directory entry [t].

    Note: this cannot be used to unlink directories. Use {!rmdir} for
    directories. *)

val rmdir : _ t -> unit
(** [rmdir t] removes directory entry [t]. This only works when the entry is
    itself a directory.

    Note: this usually requires the directory to be empty. *)

val rename : _ t -> _ t -> unit
(** [rename old_t new_t] atomically unlinks [old_t] and links it as [new_t].

    If [new_t] already exists, it is atomically replaced. *)
