(* There is a tree of cancellation contexts for each domain.
   A fiber is always in exactly one context, but can move to a new child and back (see [sub]).
   While a fiber is performing a cancellable operation, it sets a cancel function.
   When a context is cancelled, we attempt to call and remove each fiber's cancellation function, if any.
   Cancelling always happens from the fiber's own domain, but the cancellation function may be removed
   from another domain as soon as an operation is known to have succeeded.
   An operation may either finish normally or be cancelled;
   whoever manages to clear the cancellation function is responsible for resuming the continuation.
   If cancelled, this is done by calling the cancellation function. *)
