# copy

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let src = Eio_mock.Flow.make "src" in
  let dst = Eio_mock.Flow.make "dst" in
  Eio_mock.Flow.on_read src [`Return "foo"; `Return "bar"];
  Eio.Flow.copy src dst;;
+src: read "foo"
+dst: wrote "foo"
+src: read "bar"
+dst: wrote "bar"
- : unit = ()
```

Copying from src using a plain buffer (the default):

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let src = Eio.Flow.string_source "foobar" in
  let dst = Eio_mock.Flow.make "dst" in
  Eio_mock.Flow.on_copy_bytes dst [`Return 3; `Return 5];
  Eio.Flow.copy src dst;;
+dst: wrote "foo"
+dst: wrote "bar"
- : unit = ()
```
Copying from src using `Read_source_buffer`:

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let src = Eio.Flow.string_source "foobar" in
  let dst = Eio_mock.Flow.make "dst" in
  Eio_mock.Flow.set_copy_method dst `Read_source_buffer;
  Eio_mock.Flow.on_copy_bytes dst [`Return 3; `Return 5];
  Eio.Flow.copy src dst;;
+dst: wrote (rsb) ["foo"]
+dst: wrote (rsb) ["bar"]
- : unit = ()
```
