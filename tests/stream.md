# Setting up the environment

```ocaml
# #require "eio_main";;
```

```ocaml
open Eio.Std

module S = Eio.Stream

exception Cancel

let run fn =
  Eio_main.run @@ fun _ ->
  fn ()

let add t v =
  traceln "Adding %d to stream" v;
  S.add t v;
  traceln "Added %d to stream" v

let take t =

  traceln "Got %d from stream" (S.take t)

let take_nonblocking t =
  traceln "Reading from stream";
  traceln "Got %a from stream" Fmt.(option ~none:(any "None") int) (S.take_nonblocking t)

# Test cases

Simple non-blocking case

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let t = S.create 2 in
  add t 1;
  add t 2;
  take t;
  take t;;
+Adding 1 to stream
+Added 1 to stream
+Adding 2 to stream
+Added 2 to stream
+Reading from stream
+Got 1 from stream
+Reading from stream
+Got 2 from stream
- : unit = ()
```

Readers have to wait when the stream is empty:

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let t = S.create 2 in
  add t 1;
  Fiber.both
    (fun () -> take t; take t)
    (fun () -> add t 2);;
+Adding 1 to stream
+Added 1 to stream
+Reading from stream
+Got 1 from stream
+Reading from stream
+Adding 2 to stream
+Added 2 to stream
+Got 2 from stream
- : unit = ()
```

Writers have to wait when the stream is full:

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let t = S.create 3 in
  add t 1;
  Fiber.both
    (fun () ->
      add t 2;
      add t 3;
      add t 4;
    )
    (fun () ->
      take t;
      take t;
      take t;
      take t
    );;
+Adding 1 to stream
+Added 1 to stream
+Adding 2 to stream
+Added 2 to stream
+Adding 3 to stream
+Added 3 to stream

+Got 2 from stream
+Reading from stream
+Got 3 from stream
+Reading from stream
+Got 4 from stream
+Added 4 to stream
- : unit = ()
```

A zero-length queue is synchronous:

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->
  let t = S.create 0 in
  Fiber.both
    (fun () ->
      add t 1;
      add t 2;
    )
    (fun () ->
      take t;
      take t;
    );;
+Adding 1 to stream
+Reading from stream
+Got 1 from stream
+Reading from stream
+Added 1 to stream
+Adding 2 to stream
+Added 2 to stream
+Got 2 from stream
- : unit = ()
```

Cancel reading from a stream:

```ocaml
# run @@ fun () ->

  try
    Fiber.both
      (fun () -> take t)

    assert false;
  with Cancel ->
    traceln "Cancelled";
    add t 2;
    take t;;
+Reading from stream

Trying to use a stream with a cancelled context:

```ocaml

  (* Check we released the mutex correctly: *)
  Eio.Cancel.protect @@ fun () ->

Cancelling writing to a stream:
