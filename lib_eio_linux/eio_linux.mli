(** Eio backend using Linux's io_uring.

    You will normally not use this module directly.
    Instead, use {!Eio_main.run} to start an event loop and then use the API in the {!Eio} module.

    However, it is possible to use this module directly if you only want to support recent versions of Linux. *)

(** Run an event loop using io_uring.

    Uses {!Uring.create} to create the io_uring,
    and {!Uring.set_fixed_buffer} to set a [block_size * n_blocks] fixed buffer.

    Note that if Linux resource limits prevent the requested fixed buffer from being allocated
    then [run] will continue without one (and log a warning).

    For portable code, you should use {!Eio_main.run} instead, which will use this automatically
    if running on Linux with a recent-enough kernel version.

    @param fallback Call this instead if io_uring is not available for some reason.
                    The argument is a message describing the problem (for logging).
                    The default simply raises an exception. *)
