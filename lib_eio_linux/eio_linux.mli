(** Eio backend using Linux's io_uring.

    You will normally not use this module directly.
    Instead, use {!Eio_main.run} to start an event loop and then use the API in the {!Eio} module.

    However, it is possible to use this module directly if you only want to support recent versions of Linux. *)

  ?polling_timeout:int ->
  ?fallback:([`Msg of string] -> unit) ->
  (stdenv -> unit) -> unit
(** Run an event loop using io_uring.

    Uses {!Uring.create} to create the io_uring,
    and {!Uring.set_fixed_buffer} to set a [block_size * n_blocks] fixed buffer.

    Note that if Linux resource limits prevent the requested fixed buffer from being allocated
    then [run] will continue without one (and log a warning).

    For portable code, you should use {!Eio_main.run} instead, which will use this automatically
    if running on Linux with a recent-enough kernel version.

    @param fallback Call this instead if io_uring is not available for some reason.
                    The argument is a message describing the problem (for logging).
                    The default simply raises an exception. *)

(** {1 Low-level API} *)

(** Low-level API for using uring directly. *)
module Low_level : sig
  val noop : unit -> unit
  (** [noop ()] performs a uring noop. This is only useful for benchmarking. *)

  val sleep_until : float -> unit
  (** [sleep_until time] blocks until the current time is [time]. *)

  (** {1 Fixed-buffer memory allocation functions}

      The size of the fixed buffer is set when calling {!run}, which attempts to allocate a fixed buffer.
      However, that may fail due to resource limits. *)

  val alloc_fixed : unit -> Uring.Region.chunk option
  (** Allocate a chunk of memory from the fixed buffer.

      Warning: The memory is NOT zeroed out.

      Passing such memory to Linux can be faster than using normal memory, in certain cases.
      There is a limited amount of such memory, and this will return [None] if none is available at present. *)

  val alloc_fixed_or_wait : unit -> Uring.Region.chunk
  (** Like {!alloc_fixed}, but if there are no chunks available then it waits until one is. *)

  val free_fixed : Uring.Region.chunk -> unit

  val with_chunk : fallback:(unit -> 'a) -> (Uring.Region.chunk -> 'a) -> 'a
  (** [with_chunk ~fallback fn] runs [fn chunk] with a freshly allocated chunk and then frees it.

      If no chunks are available, it runs [fallback ()] instead. *)

  val openfile : sw:Switch.t -> string -> Unix.open_flag list -> int -> FD.t

  val read_exactly : ?file_offset:Optint.Int63.t -> FD.t -> Uring.Region.chunk -> int -> unit
  (** [read_exactly fd chunk len] reads exactly [len] bytes from [fd],
      performing multiple read operations if necessary.

      @param file_offset Read from the given position in [fd] (default: 0).
      @raise End_of_file Raised if the stream ends before [len] bytes have been read. *)

  val readv : ?file_offset:Optint.Int63.t -> FD.t -> Cstruct.t list -> int
  (** [readv] is like {!read_upto} but can read into any cstruct(s),
      not just chunks of the pre-shared buffer.

      If multiple buffers are given, they are filled in order. *)

  (** [write fd buf len] writes exactly [len] bytes from [buf] to [fd].

      It blocks until the OS confirms the write is done,
      and resubmits automatically if the OS doesn't write all of it at once. *)

  val writev : ?file_offset:Optint.Int63.t -> FD.t -> Cstruct.t list -> unit
  (** [writev] is like {!write} but can write from any cstruct(s),
      not just chunks of the pre-shared buffer.

      If multiple buffers are given, they are sent in order.
      It will make multiple OS calls if the OS doesn't write all of it at once. *)

  val writev_single : ?file_offset:Optint.Int63.t -> FD.t -> Cstruct.t list -> int
  (** [writev_single] is like [writev] but only performs a single write operation.
      It returns the number of bytes written, which may be smaller than the requested amount. *)

  val splice : FD.t -> dst:FD.t -> len:int -> int
  (** [splice src ~dst ~len] attempts to copy up to [len] bytes of data from [src] to [dst].

      @return The number of bytes copied.
      @raise End_of_file [src] is at the end of the file.
      @raise Unix.Unix_error(EINVAL, "splice", _) if splice is not supported for these FDs. *)

  val connect : FD.t -> Unix.sockaddr -> unit
  (** [connect fd addr] attempts to connect socket [fd] to [addr]. *)

  val await_readable : FD.t -> unit
  (** [await_readable fd] blocks until [fd] is readable (or has an error). *)

  val await_writable : FD.t -> unit
  (** [await_writable fd] blocks until [fd] is writable (or has an error). *)

  val fstat : FD.t -> Unix.stats
  (** Like {!Unix.fstat}. *)

  val read_dir : FD.t -> string list
  (** [read_dir dir] reads all directory entries from [dir].
      The entries are not returned in any particular order
      (not even necessarily the order in which Linux returns them). *)

  (** {1 Sockets} *)

  val accept : sw:Switch.t -> FD.t -> (FD.t * Unix.sockaddr)
  (** [accept ~sw t] blocks until a new connection is received on listening socket [t].

      It returns the new connection and the address of the connecting peer.
      The new connection has the close-on-exec flag set automatically.
      The new connection is attached to [sw] and will be closed when that finishes, if
      not already closed manually by then. *)

  val shutdown : FD.t -> Unix.shutdown_command -> unit
  (** Like {!Unix.shutdown}. *)

  val send_msg : FD.t -> ?fds:FD.t list -> ?dst:Unix.sockaddr -> Cstruct.t list -> unit
  (** [send_msg socket bufs] is like [writev socket bufs], but also allows setting the destination address
      (for unconnected sockets) and attaching FDs (for Unix-domain sockets). *)

  val recv_msg : FD.t -> Cstruct.t list -> Uring.Sockaddr.t * int
  (** [recv_msg socket bufs] is like [readv socket bufs] but also returns the address of the sender. *)

  val recv_msg_with_fds : sw:Switch.t -> max_fds:int -> FD.t -> Cstruct.t list -> Uring.Sockaddr.t * int * FD.t list
  (** [recv_msg_with_fds] is like [recv_msg] but also allows receiving up to [max_fds] file descriptors
      (sent using SCM_RIGHTS over a Unix domain socket). *)

  (** {1 Randomness} *)

  val getrandom : Cstruct.t -> int
  (**[ getrandom buf] reads some random bytes into [buf] and returns the number of bytes written.

     It uses Linux's [getrandom] call, which is like reading from /dev/urandom
     except that it will block (the whole domain) if used at early boot
     when the random system hasn't been initialised yet. *)
